        <h2>About me</h2><br>
        <p>
            I started learning programming this year, specifically focusing on web development. Before this, I had been studying other fields within the humanities. Diving into the world of technology felt like discovering the inner workings of the everyday things we encounter. It's like that hidden world
            that's always there but not immediately visible. Right now, I'm really interested in front-end development, and I find it to be an area that sparks creativity and enthusiasm. I'm really happy about learning web development, and I'm excited about the possibility of being part of the IT industry in the future. <br><br>Currently, I am studying in "Jóvenes a Programar" which is a course offered by "Ceibal." This year, 
            it is being conducted online with synchronous sessions and asynchronous assignments. It's a highly challenging program that is also filled with numerous opportunities. I am thrilled to be a part of it. <br>
